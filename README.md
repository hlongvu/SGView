To build a long and complex ui screen is a tedious task. We often using UITableView to make this kind of screen. Inspired by Airbnb/Epoxy library, I recreate a small and lightweight similar library for iOS. This library handles all the complex and repeatible task when dealing with UITableView DataSource and Delegate, and showing a nicer and cleaner API.

For more details and how to work with this library, please check out my blog post: [https://blog.hlongvu.com](http://bit.ly/sgview)
